                    Caring for an aging loved one is a tremendous responsibility but can present practical and logistical challenges, especially when you have work or family obligations or live far away. Hiring a professional <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/caregivers"><u>caregiver</u></a> can ensure your loved one receives the dedicated attention they need to remain safe and content in their home. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your loved one’s physical and cognitive functions diminish and their daily needs increase, they may need 24/7 in-home care. While you may consider an assisted living facility or nursing home, you have another option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Visiting Angels offers live-in and 24-hour home care, which can ensure a professional caregiver is available to address your loved one’s needs and provide <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/elderly-companion-care"><u>companion care</u></a> – day and night. Caregivers can also help with <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/private-duty-care"><u>personal care</u></a>, including grooming, bathing, dressing, toileting, meal preparation, and light housekeeping.

                <h3>Home Care for the Elderly in Their Own Homes</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, the in-home assistance you offer is not enough for your senior — primarily if they have specialized care requirements, mobility limitations, or a chronic illness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Live-in or 24-hour care can serve as a temporary solution for seniors recovering from surgery or returning from rehab. Both services can allow you or other family members to take a much-needed break or go on vacation with the peace of mind that your aging loved one is safe and secure in the comfort of their own home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professional senior care provides essential assistance for older adults on an hourly, overnight, 24-hour, and <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/respite-care"><u>respite care</u></a> basis. Care plans include various services that meet your loved one’s needs, including personal care, hygiene, housekeeping, meal preparation, transportation, medication reminders, and more. Visiting Angels also offers <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/certified-palliative-care"><u>palliative care</u></a> programs, <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/dementia-care"><u>dementia care</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/alzheimers-services"><u>Alzheimer’s care</u></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some signs indicating a switch to 24/7 care at home is needed:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    <li>Decreased agility and/or mobility due to aging, stroke, or chronic condition</li>
                    <li>Family and friends unable to provide care due to a move or change in circumstances</li>
                    <li>Feeling isolated or overwhelmed caring for themselves alone</li>
                    <li>Incontinence or difficulty with toileting</li>
                    <li>Increased confusion due to advancing dementia or age-related cognitive decline</li>
                    <li>Increased or frequent falls or trips</li>
                    <li>Mobility concerns and challenges with assistive devices</li>
                    <li>Requiring assistance with meal preparation, eating, or drinking</li>
                    <li>Returning home after hospitalization or rehabilitation</li>
                    <li>Wandering around and away from the home</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The Difference Between Live-In And 24-Hour Care</h3>
                <p>
                    Although “live-in” and “24-hour care” may sound the same, each has different terms and arrangements. Understanding the differences will help you determine the best choice for your senior’s specific needs and requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Live-in care</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Live-in caregivers stay in the home day and night to perform duties outlined in your senior’s <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/tustin/articles/do-you-have-the-right-care-plan-for-your-senior/436"><u>home care plan</u></a>. One caregiver may work during the week and another on the weekends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Live-in caregivers must receive an eight-hour break each 24 hours and a bed to rest. Also, not all Visiting Angels agencies offer live-in care.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pros:</b> With just two scheduled caregivers, the caregivers and your loved one may form a stronger bond. In addition, the caregivers may become more familiar with your senior’s favorite routines and how to address special needs and moods. Familiarity is especially beneficial to older adults who have been diagnosed with dementia.</li>
                    <li><b>Cons:</b> Your loved one will not receive direct supervision during the caregiver break. If your loved one needs access to care at all times—day and night—you may need additional support during those hours. Alternatively, another caregiver or family member could be on standby to assist during the caregiver break.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>24-hour home care</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a 24-hour home care arrangement, two or more caregivers rotate eight-hour shifts to ensure someone is always awake and available day and night to help your loved one when needed.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pros:</b> In a 24-hour home care arrangement, two or more caregivers rotate eight-hour shifts to ensure someone is always awake and available day and night to help your loved one when needed.</li>
                    <li><b>Cons:</b> A team of several caregivers will be required to meet your loved one’s 24/7 care needs instead of just two caregivers. Costs are typically higher than live-in care.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What's the Best Senior Care Choice?</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Live-in care</b> for older adultsmay be appropriate when your loved one:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sleeps through the night with minimal assistance</li>
                    <li>Does not require constant attention to prevent potentially dangerous activities like wandering</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>24-hour care</b> may be appropriate when your loved one:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wanders or poses a threat to themselves due to physical or cognitive limitations</li>
                    <li>Is frequently awake during the night or shows symptoms of <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/tustin/articles/6-ways-to-manage-your-loved-ones-sundown-syndrome/91"><u>“sundown syndrome”</u></a> – when an individual becomes more active or agitated as evening falls</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Contact Visiting Angels for Senior Care</h3>
                <p>
